<h1>Natalie's Favorite Movies</h1>
    <h2>Ranking My Top 5 Movies</h2>
    <hr/>
        <h3>1. The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938)</h3>
            <p>In my opinion the best Robin Hood movie of all time. This has been a favorite since I was 10 years old.

            </p>
        <h3>2. An Affair to Remember (1957)</h3>
            <p>Possibly the most purely romantic movie ever made.</p>
        <h3> 3. Before Sunrise (1995)</h3>
            <p>Nothing makes me want to be young and/or traveling through Europe like this movie.</p>
            <p>Captures that young adult feeling of new-found freedom, and honest, but pretentious philosophizing perfectly.</p>
        <h3> 4. Persuassion (1995) </h3>
            <p>The best adaptation of my favorite Jane Austen novel.</p>
        <h3> 5. Notorious (1946)</h3>
            <p>Spies, yearning, jealousy, romance, tension...all with absolutely perfect performances by Igrid Bergman and Cary Grant.</p>
